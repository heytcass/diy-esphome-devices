# Sendspin Player Role - Audio output (speaker)
#
# "receives audio and plays it in sync" with volume and mute controls
#
# Provides:
#   - sendspin_media_player media_player component
#
# Note: Device config should add on_play/on_pause/on_idle handlers
# if display integration is needed. This keeps the role simple and
# allows devices to customize behavior.
#
# Example device integration with display:
#   media_player:
#     - id: !extend sendspin_media_player
#       on_play:
#         - globals.set: { id: is_playing, value: "true" }
#       on_pause:
#         - globals.set: { id: is_playing, value: "false" }
#         - script.execute: debounced_refresh

# Media player for audio playback
media_player:
  - platform: sendspin
    id: sendspin_media_player
    name: Sendspin Player
